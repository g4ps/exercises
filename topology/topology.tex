\chapter*{Preface}

Those are my solutions for the James Munkres' "Topology", 2nd edition.

Majority of the notation that is used here migrated from my course on the set theory. In
my very personal opinion, notation that is used there is far superior that whatever is
happening in Munkres' book. Sometimes I use some abusive notation when it is painfully
clear what's going on.

If you decide to persue the study of topology yourself, then I highly recommend firstly
to go through a course on axiomatic set theory and logic, because first chapter of this
book is highly insufficient in this regard. My personal recommendations are the
combo by Cunningham, which includes "Set theory: A first course" and
"A Logical Introduction to Proof", or 
"A first course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory" by Michael L. Oâ€™Leary for both subjects.

we follow that $x \in f\inv[f[A_0]]$. Therefore $A_0 \subseteq f\inv[f[A_0]]$.

Suppose that $f$ is injective. Suppose that there exists $x_0 \in f\inv[f[A_0]]$ such that
$x_0 \notin A_0$. We follow that $\eangle{y, x_0}, \eangle{y, x}, \in f\inv$,
therefore $\eangle{x_0, y}, \eangle{x, y} \in f$, and because $x_0 \neq x$ we follow

\chapter{Topological Spaces and Continous Functions}

\section{Topological Spaces}

I want to state here that if $\topol \subseteq \pow(X)$ satisfies
properties
$$\set{X, \emptyset} \subseteq \topol$$
$$(\forall Y \in \pow(\topol))( \bigcup{U} \in \topol)$$
$$(\forall Y \in \pow(\topol))(Y \neq \emptyset \land |Y| <_c
|\omega|  \to \bigcap{U} \in \topol)$$
then $\topol$ is a topology on $X$.

\section{Basis for a Topology}

Let $Y \subseteq \pow(X)$. If
$$(\forall x \in X)(\exists y \in Y)(x \in y)$$
and
$$(\forall x \in X)(\exists y_1, y_2, y_3 \in Y)(x \in y_1 \cap y_3 \to
x \in y_3 \land y_3 \subseteq y_1 \cap y_2)$$
then $Y$ is a basis for a topology on $X$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Let $X$ be a topological space; Let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Suppose that for each
  $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subseteq A$. Show that $A$ is
  open in $X$.}

Let $U: A \to \pow(A)$ be an indexed function such that 
$$x \in U(x) \land U(x) \subseteq A \land U(x) \in \topol(X)$$
We want to show that $A = \bigcup{\ran(U)}$. Suppose that $x \in A$. We follow that
$x \in U(x)$. Thus $x \in \bigcup{\ran(U)}$. Therefore $A \subseteq \bigcup{\ran(U)}$.

Suppose that $z \in \bigcup{\ran(U)}$. We follow that
$$(\exists Y \in \ran(U))(z \in Y) \ra
(\exists x \in A)(z \in U(x))$$
Since $(\forall x \in A)(U(x) \subseteq A)$, we follow that $z \in A$. Thus
$\bigcup{\ran(U)} = A$.

Because $(\forall x \in A)(U(x) \in \topol(X))$, we follow that
$$\ran(U) \subseteq \topol(A)$$, therefore by definition of topology we follow that
$$\bigcup{\ran(U)} \in \topol(X)$$
as desired.

Too tedious, skip

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that the collection $\topol_c$ given in Example 4 of p. 12 is a topology on the
  set $X$. Is the collection
  $$\topol_\infty = \{U \in \pow(X):
  |X \setminus U| \geq_c |\omega| \lor X \setminus U = \emptyset \lor
  X \setminus U = X\}$$
  a topology on $X$?
}

We firstly state that
$$\topol_c = \{U \in \pow(X): |X \setminus U| \leq_c |\omega| \lor X \setminus U = X\}$$

We can follow that $X \setminus X = \emptyset$, which is countable, thus $X \in \topol_c$.
$X \setminus \emptyset = X$, therefore $\emptyset \in \topol_c$.

Suppose that $U' \subseteq \topol_c$. If $U' = \{\emptyset\}$, then $
X \setminus \bigcap{U'} = X$ and $X \setminus \bigcup{U'} = X$.
Thus assume that $U' \neq \{\emptyset\}$.

We follow that
$$(\forall u \in U')(|X \setminus u| \leq_c |\omega| \lor X \setminus u = X)$$
We follow that if $\emptyset \in U'$, then $\bigcup{U'} = \bigcup{(U' \setminus \{\emptyset\})}$.
Then we follow by DML that
$$X \setminus \bigcup\{U'\} = X \setminus \bigcup\{U' \setminus \{\emptyset\}\} =
\bigcap_{U' \setminus \{\emptyset\}}{X \setminus u}$$
we know that $(\forall u \in U')(|X \setminus u| \leq_c |\omega|)$. For any $u \in U'$ we
follow that
$$\bigcap_{u \in U' \setminus \{\emptyset\}}{X \setminus u} \subseteq X \setminus u'$$
and given that $X \setminus u'$ is countable, we follow that $\bigcap_{u \in U'}{X \setminus u}$
is countable as well, thus $\bigcup{U'} \in \topol_c$.

Now let $U' \subseteq \topol_c$ and $|U'| < |\omega|$ and $U' \neq \{\emptyset\}$.
We follow that if $\emptyset \in U'$, then $\bigcap{U'} = \emptyset$, and therefore
$X \setminus \bigcap{U'} = X$. Therefore assume that $\emptyset \notin U'$.

Then we can follow that
$$X \setminus \bigcap{U'} = \bigcup_{u \in U'}{X \setminus u}$$
Given that $U'$ is countable and $X \setminus u$ is countable we follow that
$\bigcup_{u \in U'}{X \setminus u}$ is countable, thus $X \setminus \bigcap{U'}$ is countable.

Therefore we conclude that $\topol_c$ is a topology on $X$.

Now let us consider $T_\infty$. We can state that $X \in T_\infty$ because
$X \setminus X = \emptyset$. Because $X \setminus \emptyset = X$, we follow that
$\emptyset \in T_\infty$.

Suppose that $X$ is not infinite and $T_\infty \neq \{\emptyset, X\}$. Then there exists
$u \in T_\infty$ such that $u \neq \emptyset$ and $u \neq X$. Therefore $X - u$ is
nonempty finite set, therefore $u \notin T_\infty$, which is a contradiction.
Therefore we conclude that if $X$ is finite, then $T_\infty$ is a trivial topology.

If $X$ is infinite, then we follow that we can have an injection $f: \omega \to X$.
Let $O$ be the set of odd naturals and $E$ be the set of evens. Then we follow that
$$|X \setminus f[O]| = |f[E]| \geq_c |\omega|$$
and
$$|X \setminus f[E]| =_c |f[O]| \geq_c |\omega|$$
which tells us that $f[O]$ and $f[E]$ are both in $X$. We can also follow that
$$|X \setminus f[O \cup \{0\}]| \geq |\omega|$$
thus $ f[O \cup \{0\}] \in \topol_\infty$. This gives us that
$$f[E] \cap f[O \cup \{0\}] = \{f(0)\} \in \topol_\infty$$
but $\{f(0)\}$ is a finite nonempty set for which none of the conditions of $\topol_\infty$
hold. Therefore we conclude that if $X$ is infinite, then $\topol_\infty$ is not a topology.

Therefore we conclude that if $X$ is a finite set, then $T_\infty$ is equal to a
trivial topology; if $X$ is infinite, then $T_\infty$ is not a topology at all, since
it is not closed under finite intersections.

\subsection{}

\textit{(a) if $\{\topol_\alpha\}$ is a family of topologies on $X$, show that
  $\bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$ is a topology on $X$. Is $\bigcup{\topol_\alpha}$ a topology on $X$?}

Since every topology on $X$ has $X$ and $\emptyset$ as elements, we follow that
$$\{X, \emptyset\} \subseteq \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$$
If $Y \subseteq \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$, then we follow that
$$(\forall Z \in \{\topol_\alpha\})(\bigcap{\topol_\alpha} \subseteq Z)$$
$$(\forall Z \in \{\topol_\alpha\})(Y \subseteq Z)$$
since every $Z$ is a topology, we follow that
$$(\forall Z \in \{\topol_\alpha\})(\bigcup{Y} \in Z)$$
$$\bigcup{Y} \in \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$$
If $Y$ is finite and nonempty, we can also follow that
$$(\forall Z \in \{\topol_\alpha\})(Y \in Z) \ra
(\forall Z \in \{\topol_\alpha\})(\bigcap{Y} \in Z) \ra \bigcap{Y} \in \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$$
thus we conclude that $\bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$ is a topology.

$\bigcup{\topol_\alpha}$ is not necessarily a topology. Although
$\set{X, \emptyset} \in \bigcup{\topol_\alpha}$, we cannot follow that the topology is
closed under unions. Case in point: Let $X = \set{a, b, c}$ and
$$\topol_1 = \set{\emptyset, X, \set{a}}, \topol_1 = \set{\emptyset, X, \set{b}}$$
then $Y = \topol_1 \cup \topol_2$ does not contain $\set{a, b}$, which would be necessary
for this case. Thus we conclude that in general we can't have implications for
$\bigcup{\topol_\alpha}$.

\textit{(b) Let $\set{\topol_\alpha}$ be a family of topologies on $X$. Show that there is a
  unique smallest topology on $X$ containing all the collections $\topol_\alpha$ and
  a unique largest topology contained in all $\topol_\alpha$.}

Let us take $\bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}}$. We cannot follow that presented
set is a topology on $X$, nor can we state that it is a basis of a topology. Former
is followed from the discussion in the previous section of this exercise, and the latter
cannot be followed because we don't necessarily satisfy the
second point of the definition of the basis. Namely, we don't have that
$$(\forall x \in X)(\exists y_1, y_2, y_3 \in \bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}})(x \in y_1 \cap y_3 \to
x \in y_3 \land y_3 \subseteq y_1 \cap y_2)$$
Let $Q$ be a set of all of the intersections of finite nonempty subsets of
$\bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}}$. We follow that $(\forall x \in \bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}})
(x = \bigcap{\{x\}})$, therefore $\bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}} \subseteq Q$. 
Thus we follow that $Q$ satisfies
the first requirement for the basis of $X$. Now let $x \in X$ be such that there
exist $y_1, y_2 \in Q$ such that $x \in y_1 \cap y_2$. We follow that there exist
finite subsets $Y_1, Y_2 \subseteq \bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}}$ such that 
$$y_1 = \bigcap{Y_1} \land y_2 = \bigcap{Y_2}$$
therefore
$$y_1 \cap y_2  = \bigcap{Y_1} \cap \bigcap{Y_2}$$
which is an intersection of a finite subset of $\bigcup{\topol_\alpha}$. Thus we follow that there
exists $y_3 \in Q$ such that $x \in y_3 \land y_3 \subseteq y_1 \cap y_2$. 
Therefore we can follow that the set $Q$ is indeed a basis for a topology on $X$.
Let us name the topology generated by this set as $\topol_q$.

Suppose that there is a topology, which contains
all of the topologies $\set{\topol_\alpha}$. Then we follow that it contains
$\bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}}$, therefore we follow that it contains all of the unions
of $\bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}}$, and finite intersections of subsets of
$\bigcup{\set{\topol_\alpha}}$, and thus it contains $\topol_q$. Therefore
we follow that $\topol_q$ is the smallest topology, which contains all
the topologies of $\set{\topol_\alpha}$.

Suppose that $\topol_p$ is a topology, which is contained in all of the $\set{\topol_\alpha}$.
Then we follow that $\topol_p \subseteq \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$. Because $\bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$
is a topology itself, we follow that it is the largest topology, which is contained
in all of the $\set{\topol_\alpha}$.

\textit{(c) If $X = \set{a, b, c}$, let
  $$\topol_1 = \set{\emptyset, X, \set{a}, \set{a, b}}$$
  $$\topol_2 = \set{\emptyset, X, \set{a}, \set{b, c}}$$
  Find the smallest topology containing $\topol_1$ and $\topol_2$, and the largest topology
  contained in $\topol_1, \topol_2$.
}

We can follow from previous discussions that largest contained topology is
$$\set{\emptyset, X, \set{a}}$$
and the smallest containing topology is
$$\set{\emptyset, X, \set{a}, \set{b}, \set{a, b}, \set{b, c}}$$

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that if $A$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, then the topology generated by $A$
  equals the intersection of all topologies on $X$ that contains $A$. Prove the same
  if $A$ is a subbasis.}

Let $A$ be a subbasis.
Let $\set{\topol_\alpha}$ be a set of topologies, that contain $A$ and  $\topol_A$ is
a topology generated by $A$. We can follow that $\topol_A \in \set{\topol_\alpha}$,
therefore $\bigcap{\set{\topol_\alpha}} \subseteq {\topol_A}$. If $x \in \topol_A$, then we
follow that there exists a subset $B \subseteq A$ such that $x$ is equal to some
union of some finite intersections of $B$. Since
$B \subseteq A$, we follow that $(\forall y \in \topol_\alpha)(B \subseteq y)$. Therefore
all of the finite intersections of $B$ are in any topology of $\topol_\alpha$.  Therefore
all of the unions of those intersections are in any $\topol_\alpha$. Therefore
we conclude that $(\forall y \in \topol_\alpha)(x \in y)$.
and thus $x \in \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$.
Therefore we conclude that $\topol_A \subseteq  \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$, and by double
inclusion we get that $\topol_A =  \bigcap{\topol_\alpha}$, as desired.

Since every basis of a topology is a subbasis by first clause of the definition, we follow
that the desired result holds for bases as well.

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that the topologies of $R_l$ and $R_k$ are not comparable.}

Let $[0, 1)$ be an element of a basis of topology $R_l$. Then we follow that
there are no elements of basis of standart topology on $R$ that contains $0$ and lies inside
$[0, 1)$. We can follow this by contradiction

Suppose that $0 \in (x, y)$ and $(x, y) \subseteq [0, 1)$. Since $0 \in (x, y) $,
we follow that $x < 0$. Thus we conclude that there exists $n \in Z_+$ such that
$1/n < |x|$. Therefore $-1/n \in (x, y)$ and $-1/n \notin [0, 1)$ which gives us
that $(x, y) \not \subseteq [0, 1)$, which is a contradiction.
The same logic applies to any element of basis of $R_k$.

Now let us look at the basis element $(-1, 1) \setminus K$ and the point $0$. We can
follow that $0 \in (-1, 1) \setminus K$ and suppose that there exists basis element of
$R_l$  $[a, b)$ that has point $0$ and is contained within $(-1, 1) \setminus K$.
Since $0 \in [a, b)$, we follow that $a \leq 0 < b$. Thus we conclude that there exists
$n \in Z_+$ such that $0 < 1/n < b$. Thus we conclude that $1/n \in [a, b)$ and
$1/n \notin (-1, 1) \setminus K$, since $1/n \in K$ for all $n \in Z_+$. Thus we
conclude that $R_k$ and $R_l$ are not comparable, as desired.

\subsection{}

\textit{Consider the following topologies on $R$:
  $$\topol_1 = \text{the standart topology on $R$}$$
  $$\topol_2 = \text{the topology of $R_k$}$$
  $$\topol_3 = \text{the finite complement topology}$$
  $$\topol_4 = \text{the upper limit topology, having all sets $(a, b]$ as basis}$$
  $$\topol_5 = \text{the topology having all sets
    $(-\infty, a) = \set{x: x < a}$ as a basis}$$
    Determine, for each of these topologies, which of the others it contains
}

We can follow that $T_2$ contains $T_1$, since it's finer, as proven in the chapter. The
reverse is not true, as proven in the chapter.

We can follow that $T_3$ does not contain $T_1$, because if it is, then we follow that
$(-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty)$ has finite number of points. The revese is true, since
we can divide each element of a finite complement into a union of
open intervals. For example, if $x \in T_3$ is such that $x = R \setminus \set{x_1, x_2, x_3}$
and $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$,
then we can state that $x = (-\infty, x_1) \cup (x_1, x_2) \cup (x_2, x_3) \cup (x_3, \infty)$.
We can follow that middle 2 intervals are in the basis of standart topology, and two infinite
intervals are unions of infinite set of intervals of basis.
Thus $\topol_1$ is strictly finer than $\topol_3$.

We can follow that the same logic, that worked with lower limit, works with upper limit as well.
thus we conclude that $T_4$ is strictly finer than $T_1$.

We can follow that for $(-\infty, a) \in T_5$ we can get a sequence $(x_n) = a - n$, then
get a set of intervals $\set{(a, a - 1), (x_{n + 1}, x_n)}$, all of which are in the basis of
standart topology, get another set$\set{V_{0.1}(x_n)}$ to path the holes in this set,
and take union of unions of both sets to get that $(-\infty, a) \in T_1$.

For $(a, b)$ - a set in the basis of standard topology we follow that every set in the
basis of $T_5$ contains $a - 1$, thus we conclude that $(a, b) \notin T_5$. Thus we
conclude that $T_1$ is strictly finer than $T_5$.

Topology $\topol_2$ is strictly finer than $\topol_1$, therefore we follow that
topologies that are finer than $\topol_1$ are a subset of $\topol_2$. This includes
$\topol_3$ and $\topol_5$. (Almost) the same reasoning that worked with $R_k$ and $R_l$
can be applied to show that $\topol_2$ is not finer than $\topol_4$. On the other hand,
suppose that $x \in X$ and $y \in \topol_2$ is such that $x \in y$. We follow that
if $y \in \topol_1$, then there exists an element of $\topol_4$ that is finer than
$y$. Thus assume taht $y \notin \topol_1$ and therefore is in the form
$y = (a, b) \setminus K$ for some $a, b \in R$. If $x \leq 0$, then we can have
set $(a, x] \subseteq y$ that will satisfy. Thus assume that $x > 0$. We follow that there
exists $n \in Z_+$ such that $1/n < x$. By well-ordering properties of $Z_+$ we
follow that there exists lowest $n \in Z_+$ such that $1/n  x$. Therefore we follow that
there are no elements $z \in K$ such that $1/n < z < x$. Since $x \in (a, b) \setminus K$,
we follow that $x \notin K$, therefore
$(\forall y \in (1/n, x])(y \in x \in (a, b) \setminus K)$. Therefore we conclude that
$\topol_4$ is strictly finer than $\topol_2$, which is neat.

$\topol_3$ is strictly coarser than $\topol_1$, $\topol_2$. Since $\topol_4$
is strictly finer than $\topol_2$, we follow that $\topol_3$ is coarser than $\topol_4$.
Suppose that $a < x < b$ and let $y = R \setminus \set{a, b}$ be an element of $\topol_3$.
Then we follow that no element of basis of $\topol_5$ has $x$ and does not have $a$.
If $(-\infty, a)$ is an element of $\topol_5$, then we follow that every element of topology
$\topol_3$ has numbers greater than $a$ in it (since there are infinitly  many of them).
Thus we conclude that no element of $\topol_3$ is a subset of $(-\infty, a)$. Thus we
conclude that $\topol_3$ and $\topol_5$ are not comparable.

And after all of the discussion, we can conclude that
$$[\topol_3 | \topol_5] \subset \topol_1 \subset \topol_2 \subset \topol_4$$
is the desired conclusion.

\subsection{}

\textit{(a) Apply Lemma 13.2 to show tha the countable collection
  $$B = \set{(a, b): a < b \land a, b \in Q}$$
  is a basis that generates the standard topology on $R$.}

Denote $\topol$ as a standard topology on $R$. Let $x \in \topol$. We follow that
there exists an interval $(a, b)$ in basis of standard topology such that
$x \in (a, b)$. We can follow that there exist $a', b' \in Q$ such that
$a < a' < x < b' < b$ (otherwise we run into some problem with density of rationals
in reals). Therefore we follow that $x \in (a', b')$. Lemma 13.2 tells us that
the presented result implies that $B$ is a basis for standard topology, as desired.

\textit{(b) Show that the collection
  $$C = \set{[a, b): a < b \land a, b \in Q}$$
  is a basis that genenrates a topology different from the lower limit topology on $R$.}

Proof that $C$ is a basis is trivial.
Let us look at $[\sqrt{2}, 2)$ - an element of $R_l$. Suppose that $c = [a, b) \in C$ is
such that $\sqrt{2} \in c$. Because $\sqrt{2} \notin Q$, we follow that
$a \neq \sqrt{2}$, therefore $a < \sqrt{2} < b$. Therefore we can conclude that $C$ is
not finer than $R_l$. Proving that $C$ is a subset of $R_l$ is trivial, thus
we conclude that $R_l$ is strictly finer than $C$, and thus $C$ generates a topology
different than $R_l$, as desired.

\section{The Order Topology}

\section{The Product Topology on $X \times Y$}

\section{The Subspace Topology}

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that if $Y$ is a subspace of $X$, and $A$ is a subspace of $Y$, then the topology
  $A$ inherits as a subspace of $Y$ is the same as the topology it
  inherits as a subspace of $X$.}



Suppose that $Q$ is an open set in $A$ with respect to topology, inherited from $X$.
We follow that there exists an open set in $X$  $Q_x \subseteq X$ such that $Q = Q_x \cap A$
by definition of a subspace topology. We follow that there exists open in $Y$ set $Q_y \subseteq Y$
such that $Q_y = Q_x \cap Y$. With respect to $Q_y$ there exists an open in $A$ set
$Q' = Q_y \cap A$. Thus
$$Q' = Q_y \cap A$$
$$Q' = Q_x \cap Y \cap A$$
Since $A \subseteq Y$, we follow that $Y \cap A = A$. THus
$$Q' = Q_x \cap (Y \cap A)$$
$$Q' = Q_x \cap A$$
$$Q' = Q$$
Therefore we conclude that if $Q$ is in topology of $A$ inherited from $X$, then $Q$ is also
in a topology of $A$ inherited from $Y$. Proof of the converse is pretty much the same
proof

Here's another, more logical and rigorous proof.
Denote topology of $A$ inherited from $Y$ by $\topol_A$ and topology of $A$ inherited from $X$
by $\topol_A'$. Also denote topology of $X$ by $\topol_X$ and topology of $Y$ inherited from $X$
by $\topol_Y$. Then we can state that 
$$Q \in \topol_A \lra (\exists Q_y \in \topol_Y)(Q = Q_y \cap A) \lra
(\exists Q_X \in \topol_X)(Q_y = Q_x \cap Y \land Q = Q_y \cap A) \lra$$
$$ \lra 
(\exists Q_X \in \topol_X)(Q = Q_x \cap Y  \cap A) \lra
(\exists Q_X \in \topol_X)(Q = Q_x \cap (Y  \cap A)) \lra
$$
$$ \lra 
(\exists Q_X \in \topol_X)(Q = Q_x \cap A) \lra
Q \in \topol_A'$$
thus $\topol_A' = \topol_A$ by extensionality axiom.

\subsection{}

\textit{if $\topol$ and $\topol'$ are topologies on $X$ and $\topol'$ is strictly finer
  than $\topol$, what can you cay about the corresponding topologies on the subset $Y$ of $X$.}

Denote corresponding topologies by $\topol_Y'$ and $\topol_Y$.
There're three plausible cases:

1 - we can't say nothing

2 - $\topol_Y' \supset \topol_Y$

3 - $\topol_Y' \supseteq \topol_Y$

I'm betting on the second case, so let us try to prove that. In order to do that, let us firstly
prove the third case, which is a "subcase" of the second.

Suppose that $Q \in \topol_Y$. We follow that there exists $Q_X \in \topol$ such that
$Q = Q_X \cap Y$. Since $Q_X \in \topol$, we follow by $\topol \subset \topol'$ that
$Q_x \in \topol'$. Thus $Q = Q_X \cap Y$ implies that $Q \in \topol_Y'$. Therefore we follow that
$\topol_Y' \supseteq \topol_Y$.

Although I'm betting on the second case, it seems that I'm not getting my money back.
We can follow that second case is not always true, if we substitute $\emptyset$ for $Y$.
Then $\topol_Y = \topol_Y' = \emptyset$. If we look into topologies of some
almost-trivial set, such as $X = \set{a, b, c}$, then I think that we can come up with a more
persuasive case as well. Therefore we conclude that
presented conditions imply that $\topol_Y \subseteq \topol_Y'$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Considet the set $Y = [1, 1]$ as a subspace of $R$. Which of the following sets are
  open in $Y$? Which are open in $R$?
  $$A = \set{x : \frac{1}{2} < |x| < 1 }$$
  $$B = \set{x : \frac{1}{2} < |x| \leq 1 }$$
  $$C = \set{x : \frac{1}{2} \leq |x| < 1 }$$
  $$D = \set{x : \frac{1}{2} \leq |x| \leq 1 }$$
  $$E = \set{x : 0 < |x| < 1 \land 1/x \notin Z_+ }$$
}

We can follow that
$A = (-1, -1/2) \cup (1/2, 1)$
is open in both $Y$ and $R$.

$B = [-1, -1/2) \cup (1/2, 1]$
is a union of two rays in $Y$, therefore we follow that it is open in $Y$. For $R$ we've got that
there is no open interval, that contains a point $1$ and does not contain anything larger
then $1$. Therefore we conclude that given set is not a union of open intervals, and therefore
it is not open in $R$.

We can follow pretty easily that $C$ and $D$ are not open in both $Y$ and $R$ since there is
no open interval/ray that contains $1/2$ and does not contain anything in the interval
$(-1/2, 1/2)$.

We can represent $E$ as
$$E = (-1, 0) \cup ((0, 1) \setminus K)$$
We follow that $(-1, 0)$ is an element of a basis of both $Y$ and $R$. Suppose
that $x \in (0, 1) \setminus K$. Then we follow that there exist lowest $n_1 \in Z_+$ such that
$1/n_1 < x < 1/(n_1 + 1)$. Therefore we can conclude that if $x \in E$, then there exist
a basis element $Q$ of both $Y$ and $R$ such that $x \in Q \subseteq Y, R$. Therefore
we follow that $E$ is an open set in both $Y$ and $R$.

\subsection{}

\textit{A map $f: X \to Y$ is said to be an open map if for every open set $U$ of $X$, the
  set $f(U)$ is open in $Y$. Show that $\pi_1: X \times Y \to X$ and
  $\pi_2 : X \times Y \to Y$ are open maps.}

Suppose that $Q \in X \times Y$ is an open set. Therefore we follow that it is a union of
some element of a basis of $X \times Y$, therefore there exist a subset $R$ of a basis of
$X \times Y$ such that $Q = \bigcap{R}$. From a set theory course we know that
$$U[\bigcup{G}] = \bigcup{\set{R[C]: C \in G}}$$
for any relation $U$. Therefore we can follow that the same result holds for functions
$\pi_1, \pi_2$. We can follow that for any $r \in R$ we've got that both $\pi_1(r)$ and
$\pi_2(r)$ are open by the definition of a basis for the product topology. Therefore we
conclude that $\pi_1[Q] = \pi_1[\bigcup{R}] = \bigcup{\set{\pi_1[\bigcup{r}]: r \in R}}$.
Therefore we conclude that $\pi_1[Q]$ is a union of open sets of $X$, therefore we conclude that
it is in topology of $X$. We can follow the simular result for $\pi_2$ using simular logic.

\subsection{}

\textit{Let $X$ and $X'$ denote a single set in the topologies $\topol$ and $\topol'$
  respectively; let $Y$ and $Y'$ denote a single set in the topologies $U$ and $U'$,
  respectively. Asuume that these sets are nonempty. }

There're a couple of ways to deconstruct the text of this exercise: 
we can assume that  $X = X'$,
$Y = Y'$, $X \in \topol$, $X' \in \topol'$, $Y \in U$ and $Y' \in U'$,
or we can assume that $X \in \topol$, $X' \in \topol'$, $Y \in U$ and $Y' \in U'$
without $X = X'$ and $Y = Y'$. The latter case will obviously present some problems
in the proofs, therefore we will assume that the author intended to use the former case.

\textit{(a) Show that if $\topol' \supseteq \topol$ and $U' \supseteq U$, then the product
  topology on $X' \times Y'$ is finer than the product topology on $X \times Y$}

Let $\basis$ denote the basis for $\topol_{X \times Y}$. Let $q \in X \times Y$.
Because $\basis$ is a basis for $\topol_{X \times Y}$ we follow that there exists
$b \in \basis$ such that $q \in b$. Since $b \in \basis$, we follow that there
exist $x \in \topol$ and $y \in U$ such thaht $b = x \times y$.
Since $\topol \subseteq \topol'$ and $U \subseteq U'$,
we follow that $x \in \topol'$ and $y \in U'$. Therefore $x \times y \in \basis'$
where $\basis'$ denotes the basis for $\topol_{X' \times Y'}$. Therefore we conclude that
for every $x \in X \times Y$ and every basis element $q \in \basis$ there exists
$q' \in \basis'$ such that $q' \subseteq q$ and $x \in q'$. Therefore we conclude that
$\topol_{X \times Y} \subseteq \topol_{X' \times Y'}$, as desired.

\textit{(b) Does the converse of (a) hold? Justify your answer.}

Let $\topol$ and $\topol'$ be defined on a set $Q = \set{a, b}$ and
$U$ and $U'$ be defined on $W = \set{c, d}$.
Let $X = X' = \set{a}$, $Y = Y' = \set{c}$, $\topol = \set{\emptyset, \set{a}, \set{b}, Q}$,
$\topol' = \set{\emptyset, \set{a}, Q}$, and $U = U'$. Then we follow that
topology defined on $X \times Y$ is finer than the topology defined $X' \times Y'$ (and vice versa),
but $\topol'$ is not finer than $\topol$.



\subsection{}

\textit{Show that the countable collection
  $$\set{(a, b) \times (c, d): a < b \land c < d \land a, b, c, d \in Q}$$
  is a basis for $R^2$.}

Let us denote this set by $L$.
Suppose that $x \in R^2$. We follow that there exist $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \in Q$ such that
$x_1 < x < x_2$ and $y_1 < y < y_2$, therefore $(\exists l \in L)(x \in l)$. Thus we follow that
the first condition of a definition of a basis is sastisfied. The last condition can be satisfied
by through the argument about the density of rationals in reals.


We can follow that topology, that is presented by given basis is a subset of the standard topology
on $R^2$, and we can follow though pretty much the same argument that given topology is
finer than the standard topology. Therefore I'm pretty sure that we can state that given basis
generates the standard topology (I'll not provide any proof of that, just stating what I think).


\subsection{}

\textit{Let $X$ be an ordered set. If $Y$ is a proper subset of $X$ that is
  convex in $X$, does it follow that $Y$ is an interval or a ray in $X$?}

Don't think so. I think that the author tries to give us a hint to what's going to come afterwards
(probably something about the completeness and whatnot).

Pretty sure, that we don't need to prove that $Q$ is a totally ordered set, so we're going to
take it as a given. Let
$$M = \set{x \in Q: x^2 < 2 \land x \geq 0}$$
(I've added the latter condition in order not to be bogged down  by
several cases, depending on the sign).
Let $x < y \in M$. Suppose that $z \in Q$ is such that  $x < z < y$. Then
we follow that $z > x  \geq  0$, thus $z > 0$. Since all of the numbers are positive,
we're justified to square them and get that
$x^2 < z^2 < y^2$. Given that $y^2 < 2$, we conclude that $z^2 < 2$ as well. Therefore
we follow that $z \in M$. Thus we can follow that $z \in (x, y) \ra z \in M$. Therefore
we can state that presented set is convex.

Given that $M$ is bounded above and below, we follow that it is not a ray. Suppose that
it is an interval. Then we follow that there exists $k \in Q$ such that $M = [0, k)$. Therefore
we follow that $k$ is a least lower bound of $M$, which is not the case, as proven in numerous
real analysis books. Thus we conclude that $M$ is not an interval.

\subsection{}

\textit{If $L$ is a straight line in the plane, describe the topology $L$ inherits as
  a subspace of $R_l \times R$ and as a subspace of $R_l \times R_l$. In each case it is a
  familiar topology.}

Let $\basis$ be the basis for $R_l \times R$ and $\basis'$ be the basis for $R_l \times R$.
Let $q \in \basis$  and suppoe that $b = L \cap q \neq \emptyset$. From plotting elements
of the basis and the line itself on the graph, we can conclude that $b$ is some sort of an interval
on the plane (either closed or open), and it might as well be a ray (once again, open or closed).
In case with $R_l \times R_l$ we conclude that the topology here is once again open or closed
intervals on the plane.

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that the dictionary order topology on the set $R \times R$ is the same
  as the product topology $R_d \times R$, where $R_d$ denotes $r$ in the discrete topology.
  Compare this topology with the standard topology on $R^2$.}

Let $\eangle{x, y} \in R^2$. We follow that there exists $q$ - element of basis of $R_d \times R$
such that $\eangle{x, y} \in q$. Because $q$ is an element of a basis, we follow that
$q = w \times r$, where $w \in \topol_{R_d}$ and $r \in \topol_R$. Because $r \in \topol_R$,
we follow that there exists $(a, b)$ such that $(a, b) \subseteq r$. Therefore we follow that
element $\set{x} \times (a, b)$ is an element of a basis of dictionary order such that
$\set{x} \times (a, b) \subseteq q$. Therefore we follow that $R_d \times R$ is
coarser than dictionary order topology.

Suppose that $\eangle{x, y}$ is in $R^2$ and $q$ is in basis of dictionary topology of $R^2$
such that $\eangle{x, y} \in q$. By definition (and immediate implications of thereof )
we follow that the set $q \cap \set{x} \times R$ is nonempty. Since $\eangle{x, y}$
is in $q$, and $q$ is a basis element, we follow
that there exist $a, b \in R$ such that $\set{x} \times (a, b) \subseteq q$ (follows from
definitions and maybe some trivial manipulations of definition of dictionary order). Since
$\set{x} \times (a, b)$ is an element of a basis of $R_d \times R$, we conclude that
dictionary order topology is coarser than $R_d \times R$, and thus by double inclusion
we conclude that topology over $R_d \times R$ and dictionary order topologies
are equal, as desired.

We can follow that topology in  $R_d$ is strictly finer than standard topology of $R$
since $R_d = \pow(R)$, and thus it is the largest possible topology. Strictness follows
from the fact that $\set{0} \in \topol_{R_d}$ and $\set{0} \notin \topol_R$.

Thus we can be pretty sure that there is no element of basis of standard topology on $R \times R$
that contains $\set{0} \times R$. Since every element of basis of $R \times R$ is also contained
in $R_d \times R$, we conclude that standard topology on $R^2$ is coarser than $R_d \times R$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Let $I = [0, 1]$. Compare the product topology on $I \times I$, the dictionary order
  topology on $I \times I$, and the topology $I \times I$ inherits as a subspace of $R \times R$
  in the dictionary order topology.
}

Wanted to skip this one, since I've solved it incorrecttly the first time, but
instead of skipping I'll just present the half-assed proof here for completeness' sake.

Important thing to remember: sets such as $\set{x} \times [0, 0.1)$ are not elements of basis
of dictionary topology on $I \times I$ 

Let us look at the point $\eangle{0.5, 1}$ and basis element of standard topology
$[0, 1] \times (0.5, 1]$. We can follow that since the elements of dictionary bases
cannot just stop at the corners and must wrap around, we follow that there is no element of
basis of dictionary order topology, that is contained in presented element of basis
and contains the desired point.

We can follow also that $\set{0.5} \times (0, 1)$ cannot be presented in
standard topology as well. Thus the first two are not comparable

Suppose that $\eangle{x, y} \in I \times I$ and $q$ is the basis element with respect to
the dictionary order topology. We follow that we can take a "strand" from
dictionary (i.e. take a set $\set{x} \times R \cap q$, where $q$ is an element of the basis,
that contains point $\eangle{x, y}$) and get that dictionary order over $I \times I$ is coarser than
the topology $I \times I$ inherits as a subspace of $R \times R$ in the dictionary order topology,
since the strand is the element of the basis of the latter. We can pull the same trick
that we've used in the previous paragraph to show that the inherited topology is strictly coarser
than the dictionary topology. Using the "strand" method (i.e. taking basis elements
in form $\set{x} \times (a, b)$ or its closed analogs) we can prove that the last topology
is strictly finer than the standard topology on $I \times I$.


\section{Closed Sets and Limit Points}

\subsection{}

\textit{let $C$ be a collection of subsets of the set $X$. Suppose that $\emptyset$ and
  $X$ are in $C$, and that finite unions and arbitrary intersections of elements of $C$
  are in $C$. Show that ther collectionn
  $$T = \set{X \setminus C: C \in C}$$
  is a topology on $X$.}

We're gonna use the definition of topology on this one. We follow that
since $X$ and $\emptyset $ are in $C$ that
$$X \setminus X = \emptyset \in T$$
$$X \setminus \emptyset = X \in T$$

Assume that $J$ is an arbitrary subset of $T$. We follow that
for every $j \in J$ there exists a unique $k \in C$ such that $j = X \setminus k$. Thus we
follow that there exists $C' \subseteq C$ such that 
$$\set{j: j \in J} = \set{X \setminus k: k \in C'}$$
thus
$$\bigcup{J} = \bigcup{\set{j: j \in J}} = \bigcup{\set{X \setminus k: k \in C'}} =
X \setminus \bigcap{\set{k: k \in C'}} = X \setminus \bigcap{C'}$$
where we've used DML to justify one of the equations.
Since $C'$ is an arbitrary subset of $C$ we follow that $\bigcap{C'} \in C$. Thus we follow that
$X \setminus \bigcap C' \in T$. Thus we follow that
$J \subseteq T \ra \bigcup{J} \in T$. Therefore we've got second property of topology.

If $J$ is a finite subset of $T$, then we follow that
we can define $C'$ by the same definition and that $C'$ is finite as well. Thus 
$$\bigcap{J} = \bigcap{\set{j: j \in J}} = \bigcap{\set{X \setminus k: k \in C'}} =
X \setminus \bigcup{\set{k: k \in C'}} = X \setminus \bigcup{C'}$$
thus we follow that if $J$ is a finite subset of $T$ , then $\bigcap{J} \in T$, therefore
we've got the third and final condition of topology. Thus we follow that $T$ is a
topology,  as desired.


\subsection{}

\textit{Show that if $A$ is closed in $Y$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$}

Since $Y$ is closed in $X$  we follow that $Y \subseteq X$. Assuming that the
topology on $Y$ is a subset topology, we follow that if $A$ is a closed set in $Y$,
then there exists $A' \subseteq X$ such that $A'$ is closed and $A = A' \cap Y$.
Since both $A'$ and $Y$ are closed in $X$ we follow that $A = A' \cap Y$ is closed in $X$
as well by definition of topology, as desired.

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that if $A$ is closed in $X$ and $B$ is closed in $Y$, then $A \times B$
  is closed in $X \times Y$.}

If $A$ is closed in $X$, then we follow that there exists $A'$ such that
$A = X \setminus A'$, where $A'$ is an open set in $X$. Same goes for $B = Y \setminus B'$.
Thus we follow that $A' \times B'$ is an open set in $X \times Y$. 
one of the exercises in chapter 1 gives us that
$$(A \times B) = (X \setminus A') \times (Y \setminus B') =
(X \times Y \setminus A' \times Y) \setminus X \times B'$$

We follow that $A' \times Y$ is an open set, then $(X \times Y \setminus A' \times Y)$
is a closed set. We follow also that $X \times B'$ is an open set,
thus $X \times Y \setminus X \times B'$ is a closed set. Thus
$$(X \times Y \setminus A' \times Y) \setminus X \times B' =
(X \times Y \setminus A' \times Y) \cap (X \times Y \setminus  X \times B')$$
is an intersection of closed sets and therefore is closed itself. Thus
we conclude that $A \times B$ is a closed set, as desired. (we can also follow the same thing
by the following exercise)

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that if $U$ is open in $X$ and $A$ is closed in $X$, then
  $U \setminus A$ is open in $X$ and $A \setminus U$ is closed in $X$.}


Firstly I want to prove that if $A, B \subseteq X$, then
$$A \setminus B = A \cap (X \setminus B)$$
We follow that by
$$x \in A \setminus B \lra x \in A \land x \notin B \lra x \in A \land x \in X \land x \notin B
\lra x \in A \land (x \in X \setminus B) \lra x \in A \cap (X \setminus B)$$

We can follow by the fact that $U, A \subseteq X$ that 
$$U \setminus A = U \cap (X \setminus A)$$
and
$$A \setminus U = A \cap (X \setminus U)$$
In the former case we've got finite intersection of two open sets,
and in the latter we've got finite intersection of two closed sets,
thus proving that $U \setminus A$ is open and $A \setminus U$ is closed, as desired.

\subsection{}

\textit{Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology. Show that
  $\overline{(a, b)} \subseteq [a, b]$. Under what conditions
  does equality hold?}

Let us firstly state that $a, b \in X$.
We follow that $(a, b) \subseteq [a, b]$, thus $[a, b]$ is a closed set that contains
$(a, b)$, therefore by definition of closure we follow that $\overline{(a, b)} \subseteq [a, b]$.

We follow that $\overline{(a, b)} = [a, b]$ if and only if $a, b$ are limit points of
$(a, b)$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Let $A, B$ and $A_\alpha$ denote subsets of a space $X$. Prove the following}

\textit{(a) If $A \subset B$, then $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$}

Assume that $A \subseteq B$. Let $x \in \overline{A}$. We follow that
every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$. Thus every heighborhood of $x$ intersects $B$
by the fact that $A \subseteq B$. 
Therefore $x \in \overline{B}$. Therefore $\overline{A} \subseteq \overline{B}$.

\textit{(b) $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$}

Let $x \in \overline{A \cup B}$. We follow that every heighborhood of $x$
intersects $A \cup B$. Thus every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ or $B$.
Assume that $x \notin \overline{A}$ and $x \notin \overline{B}$. Then we follow that
there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U \cap A = \emptyset$.
There also exists neighborhood $U'$ of $x$ such that $U' \cap B$.
Thus we follow that $U \cap U'$ is a neighborhood of $x$ such that it does
not intersect $A$ nor $B$. Thus $x \notin \overline{A \cup B}$, which is a contradiction.
Thus we conclude that $x \in \overline{A \cup B} \ra x \in \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$.

If $x \in \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$, then $x \in \overline{A}$ or $x \in \overline{B}$.
Assume that the former is true. Then we follow that $x \in \overline{A}$.
Thus we follow that every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$. Since $A \subseteq A \cup B$,
we follow that every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A \cup B$. Thus $x \in \overline{A \cup B}$,
as desired.

\textit{(c) $\overline{\bigcup A_\alpha} \supseteq \bigcup \overline{A_\alpha}$. }

I think that we need to assume here that $A_\alpha \subseteq \pow(X)$
and what we actually need to prove is that
$$\overline{\bigcup A_\alpha} \supseteq \bigcup \set{\overline{a}: a \in A_\alpha}$$
if that's the case, then we follow that if $x \in \bigcup \set{\overline{a}: a \in A_\alpha}$,
then there exists $x \in a \in A_\alpha$ such that $x \in \overline{a}$.
This means that every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $a$ at some point.
Since $a \subseteq \bigcup A_\alpha$, we follow that every neighborhood of
$x$ intersects $\bigcup A_\alpha$ at some point and thus
$x \in \overline{\bigcup A_\alpha}$.

We can follow that if $A_\alpha = \set{\set{1/n}: n \in Z_+}$ and we've got
standard topology on reals, then $0 \in \overline{\bigcup{A_\alpha}}$,
but $0 \notin \bigcup \set{\overline{a}: a \in A_\alpha}$, since there is
no $a \in A_\alpha$ such that $0 \in \overline{a}$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Critsize the following "proof" that
  $\overline{\bigcup A_\alpha} \subseteq \bigcup \overline{A_\alpha}$:
  if $\set{A_\alpha}$ is a collection of sets in $X$ and if
  $x \in \overline{\bigcup A_\alpha}$,
  then every neighborhood of $U$ intersects $\bigcup \overline{A_\alpha}$.
  Thus $U$ must intersets some $A_\alpha$, so that $x$ must belong to the
  closure of some $A_\alpha$. Therefore $x \in \bigcup{\overline{A_\alpha}}$.}

We don't have implication "Thus $U$ must intersects some $A_\alpha$, so that $x$ must belong to the
closure of some $A_\alpha$", as it was just made up. Althought every neighborhood of $x$
indeed intersects some $A_\alpha$, there's no implication that there exists $A_\alpha$
such that every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A_\alpha$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Let $A, B$ and $A_\alpha$ denote subsets of a space $X$. Determine whether the
  following equations hold; if an equality fails, determine whether one of the
  inclusions holds.}

\textit{(a) $\overline{A \cap B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$.}

If $x \in \overline{A \cap B}$, then we follow that every neighborhood of $x$
intersects $A \cap B$ at some point. Thus every neighborhood of $x$ intersects
$A$ and $B$. Thus $x \in \overline{A}$ and $x \in \overline{B}$. Thus we've got
forward inclusion.

If $x \in \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$, then we follow that every neighborhood of $x$
intersects $A$ and every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $B$. Thus every
neighborhood of $x$ intersects both $A$ and $B$. This does not mean that
every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A \cup B$ since points of intersection can be different.
We can come up with some counterexample for this claim:
for example we can set $A = \set{1/2n: n \in Z_+}$ and
$B = \set{1/(2n + 1): n \in Z_+}$. We follow that $A \cap B = \emptyset$ and thus
$\overline{A \cap B} = \emptyset$, but $\overline{A} \cap \overline{B} = \set{0}$.

Therefore we follow only the forward inclusion.

\textit{(b) $\overline{\bigcap{A_\alpha}} = \bigcap{\overline{A_\alpha}}$}

We're once again struck with this awful notation, so let's change that
$$\overline{\bigcap{A_\alpha}} = \bigcap_{a \in A_\alpha}{\overline{a}}$$
we follow that reverse inclusion is not true, since that would imply
the correctness of counterexample in previous point.

We follow the forward inclusion by pretty much the same logic as in previous one

If $x \in \overline{\bigcap{A_\alpha}}$, then we follow that every neighborhood of $x$
intersects $\bigcap{A_\alpha}$ at some point. Thus every neighborhood of $x$ intersects
every $a \in A_\alpha$. Thus $(\forall a \in A_\alpha)(x \in \overline{a})$.
Therefore we follow that $a \in \bigcap_{a \in A_\alpha}{\overline{a}}$.
Thus we've got forward inclusion.

\textit{(c) $\overline{A \setminus B} = \overline{A} \setminus \overline{B}$}

We've got a case against
$\overline{A \setminus B} \subseteq  \overline{A} \setminus \overline{B}$
by setting once again $A = \set{1/2n: n \in Z_+}$, $B = \set{1/(2n + 1): n \in Z_+}$.
We follow that $A \setminus B = A$ since they are disjoint. Therefore we follow that
$0 \in \overline{A \setminus B}$ but $0 \notin \overline{A} \setminus \overline{B}$,
since $0 \in \overline{B}$.

If $x \in \overline{A} \setminus \overline{B}$, then we follow that
every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$, but $x$ is not in $\overline{B}$.
Assume that some neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ only at a points $A \cap B$.
Then we follow that $x \in \overline{A \cap B}$ and thus $x \in \overline{A} \cap
\overline{B}$. Therefore $x \in \overline{B}$, which is a contradiction.
Therefore we follow that if $x \in \overline{A} \setminus \overline{B}$
then every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A \setminus B$. Therefore
$x \in \overline{A \setminus B}$, which gives us reverse inclusion.

\textit{Let $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$. Show that in the space $X \times Y$
  $$\overline{A \times B} = \overline{A} \times \overline{B}$$.}

Let $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$ be such that  $\eangle{x, y} \in \overline{A \times B}$.
Let $U$ be an arbitrary neighborhood of $X$ and $V$ be an arbitrary neighborhood for $y$.
We follow that $U \times V$ is an evement of basis of $X \times Y$ that contains
$\eangle{x, y}$, and thus it intersects $A \times B$.
Therefore there exists $\eangle{q, w} \in A \times B \cap U \times V$.
Thus we follow that $\eangle{q, w} \in (A \cap U) \times (B \cap V)$.
Therefore we follow that $U$ intersects $A$ and $V$ intersects $B$.
Since $U$ and $V$ are arbitrary, we follow that every neighborhood of $x$ intersects
$A$ and every neighborhood of $y$ intersects $B$. Thus $x \in \overline{A}$ and
$y \in \overline{B}$ and thus $\eangle{x, y} \in \overline{A} \times \overline{B}$.

Suppose that $x \in X, y \in Y$ are such that $\eangle{x, y} \in \overline{A} \times \overline{B}$.
We follow that $x \in \overline{A}$ and $y \in \overline{B}$. Assume that $U \times V$ is a
basis element of $X \times Y$ that contains $\eangle{x, y}$.
We follow that $U$ intersects $A$ and $V$ intersects $B$. Thus there exist
$u \in U \cap A$ and $v \in V \cap B$. Therefore $\eangle{u, v} \in A \times B \cap U \times V$.
Therefore $U \times V$ intersects $A \times B$. Thus we follow that every
basis element that contains $\eangle{x, y}$ intersects $A \times B$, and thus
$\eangle{x, y} \in \overline{A \times B}$.

Double inclusion produces the desired equality, as desired.

\textit{Show that every order topology is Hausdorff.}

Let $X$ be a toset, and let $\topol$ be respective order topology.
I think that definition, that is presented in the book implies that if there is only one element
in $X$, then the topology is vacuously Hausdorff (same goes for empty set).
Thus assume that $X$ contains at least two elements, and let $x_1, x_2 \in X$ be such
that $x_1 \neq x_2$. Since $x_1, x_2 \in X$ and $x_1 \neq x_2$, we follow
that $x_1 \prec x_2$ or $x_2 \prec x_1$. Assume the former.

Essentially we want to
produce two open sets, that will prove that the space is Hausdorff, and
those two sets will be just plain old intervals. But we've got two cases:
there could exist $x_3$ such that $x_1 \prec x_3 \prec x_2$, or there might not.
If such an element exists, then set $b_1 = a_2 = x_3$. If there is no such element, then
set $b_1 = x_2$ and $a_2 = x_1$. 
Let $a_1$ be either the lowest element of $X$ if such exists, or some element that
is less than $x_1$ in case that it does not exist.
Let $b_2$ be either the largest element of $X$ if such exists, or some element that
is larger than $x_2$ in case that it does not exist.

Then we can follow that $x_1 \in (a_1, b_1)$ and $x_2 \in (a_2, b_2)$ and
$(a_1, b_1) \cap (a_2, b_2) = \emptyset$ by their respective definitions.
Thus we follow that the space is Hausdorff, as desired.

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that the product of two Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff.}

Let $X$ be the first spacce and let $Y$ be the second.
Let $\eangle{x_1, y_1}, \eangle{x_2, y_2} \in X \times Y$.
We follow that $x_1 \neq x_2$ or $y_2 \neq y_2$. 
If we've got $A_1, A_2 \subseteq X$ and $B_1, B_2 \subseteq Y$ such that
$A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset$ or $B_1 \cap B_2 =  \emptyset$, then we follow that
$$A_1 \times B_1 \cap A_2 \times B_2 = (A_1 \cap A_2) \times (B_1 \cap B_2) = \emptyset$$
the desired result follows easily from that.

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that a subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.}

Assume that $X$ is a Hausdorff space and let $Y \subseteq X$. Let $y_1, y_2 \in Y$.
We follow that there exist open sets $U, V \subseteq X$ such that
$y_1 \in U, y_2 \in V, U \cap V = \emptyset$ by the fact that $X$ is Hausdorff.
We follow that $U \cap Y$ and $V \cap Y$ are open sets in $Y$, and since
$U \cap V = \emptyset$, we follow that $(U \cap Y) \cap (V \cap Y) = \emptyset$
by commutatitvity and assocoativity of $\cap$. Therefore we conclude that
supspace generated by $Y$ is a Hausdorff. Since $Y$ is arbitrary, we follow that
any subspace of $X$ is Hausdorff, as desired.

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that $X$ is Hausdorff iff diagonal $\Delta = \set{x \times x: x \in X}$
  is closed in $X \times X$.}

Since $X$ is Hausdorff, we follow that for all $x \in X$ we've got that $\set{\eangle{x, x}}$
is closed.

Assume that $\Delta \neq \overline{\Delta}$ and thus there exists
$\eangle{y_1, y_2} \in \overline{\Delta} \setminus \Delta$
We follow that since $\eangle{y_1, y_2} \notin \Delta$ that $y_1 \neq y_2$. We also
follow that $y_1, y_2 \in X$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, we follow that
$y_1, y_2 \in X$ implies that there exist neighborhoods $U, V \subseteq X$ of $y_1$
and $y_2$ respestively, such taht $U \cap V = \emptyset$. Thus
we follow that $U \times V$ is an open set in $X \times X$.
Then we follow that since $\eangle{y_1, y_2} \in \overline{\Delta}$ that
there exists $d \in \Delta$ such that $d \in U \cap V$. Thus we follow that
there exists $d_1 \in X$ such that $\eangle{d_1, d_1} = d$. Therefore
$\eangle{d_1, d_1} \in U \times V$ and therefore $d_1 \in U \land d_1 \in V$,
which implies that $d_1 \in U \cap V$, which is a contradiction, since $U \cap V = \emptyset$
by the fact that $X$ is Hausdorff, as desired.

Therefore we conclude that $\overline \Delta \setminus \Delta = \emptyset$, therefore
$\Delta = \overline{\Delta}$ and $\Delta$ is a closed set, thus giving us forward
implication.

Now assume that $\Delta$ is a closed set and $X$ is not Hausdorff. Since $X$
is not Hausdorff, we follow taht there exists $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that
$x_1 \neq x_2$ and
for all $U \in \topol$ we've got that $x_1 \in U \ra x_2 \in U$.

Let $B$ be an arbitrary basis element that contains $\eangle{x_1, x_2}$. We follow that
since it is a basis element, that $B = U \times V$, where $U, V$ are open subsets
of $X$. We follow that $x_1 \in U$ and $x_2 \in V$, that implies that
$x_1, x_2 \in U$ and $x_1, x_2 \in V$. Thus we follow that $\eangle{x_1, x_2} \in B$.
Therefore we follow that if $B$ is a basis element, that contains $\eangle{x_1, x_2}$,
then $B$ intersects $\Delta$ by the fact that $\eangle{x_1, x_1}$ and $\eangle{x_2, x_2}$
are both in $B$. Thus we follow that $\eangle{x_1, x_2} \in \overline{\Delta}$.
Since $x_1 \neq x_2$ we follwo that $\eangle{x_1, x_2} \notin \Delta$, which implies
that $\Delta \neq \overline{\Delta}$, which implies that $\Delta$ is not closed,
which is a contradiction. Thus we follow that if $\Delta$ is a closed set,
then $X$ is Hausdorff, which gives us reverse implication, as desired.

\subsection{}

\textit{In the finite complement topology on $R$, to what point or points does
  the sequence $x_n = 1/n$ converge?}

We can follow pretty easily that finite topology  on $R$ is not Hausdorff
by the fact that if $U, V$ are nonempty open sets in finite complement topology,
then $U = R \setminus S_1$, $V = R \setminus S_1$ for some finite subsets $S_1, S_2$ of $R$.
Thus we follow that $U \cap V = R \setminus S_1 \cap R \setminus S_2 =
R \setminus (S_1 \cup S_2)$, where we follow that $S_1 \cup S_2$ is finite and therefore
$R \setminus (S_1 \cup S_2)$ is infinite and therefore nonempty.

Assume that $U$ is a neighborhood of $0$. We follow that
$U = R \setminus S_1$ such that $0 \notin S_1$. and $S_1$ is finite.
Since  $x_n$ is an infinite sequence, we follow that there must exist
$n$ such that $n_0 > n \ra x_n \notin S_1 \ra x_n \in U$. Thus we conclude that $x_n$
converges to $0$.

By the same logic we follow that if $U$ is a neighborhood of any other number, then
the same logic applies. Therefore we follow that $x_n$ converges to any number in finite
complement topology.

\subsection{}

\textit{Show that $T_1$ axiom is equivalent to the condition that for each pair
  of points of $X$, each has a neighborhood not containing the other.}

Let $x_1, x_2 \in X$ are such that $x_1 \neq x_2$. $T_1$ axiom implies that
$\set{x_1}$ and $\set{x_2}$ are closed and thus $X \setminus \set{x_1}$ and
$X \setminus {x_2}$ are open. Since $x_1 \neq x_2$, we follow that
$x_2 \in X \setminus \set{x_1}$ and $x_1 \in X \setminus \set{x_2}$,
thus implying that each point has a neighborhood, that does not contain the other point.

\subsection{}

\textit{Consider the five topologies on $R$ given in Exercise 7 of paragraph 13.}

\textit{(a) Determine the closure of the set $K = \set{1/n: n \in Z_+}$ under each of
  these topologies.}

Under standard topology we follow that $\overline{K} = K \cap \set{0}$ from real
analysis course.

Under $K$ topology we follow that $R$ is open by default, and thus $R \setminus K$ is
a basis element, therefore it is open and thus $K = R \setminus (R \setminus K)$ is closed.

Under finite complement topology we follow that all closed sets that are not $R$ are
finite, and thus only $R$ contains $K$. Therefore $\overline{K} = R$. 

Since the upper limit topology is finer than the $K$-topology, we follow that
$R \setminus K$ is an open set in upper limit topology, and thus $\overline{K} = K$.

For the topology that has sets $(-\infty, a)$ as a basis, we follow that
closed sets there are either $R$ or $[a, \infty)$ for some $a \in R$, and thus
$\overline{K} = [0, \infty)$.

\textit{(b) Which of these topologies satisfy the Hausdorff axiom? The $T_1$ axiom?}

We follow that standard topology satisfies the Hausdorff axiom, as proven in the
chapter or in the real analysis course. Thus we follow that since standard topology
is coarser than $K$-topology and upper limit topology, that both of them
satisfy the axiom as well. In exercise 14 of this section we've shown that
finite complement topology is definetly not Hausdorff, and for the last topology
we follow that if $0 \in U$, then $-1 \in U$, therefore it is not Hausdorff as well.

In the chapter we've discussed that $T_1$ axiom is weaker than Hausdorff, thus we follow that
standard topology, $K$-topology and upper limit topology all satisfy the $T_1$ axiom.
We can follow that finite complement topology satisfies $T_1$ by some trivial
implications and the last topology is definetly does not satisfy $T_1$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Consider teh lower limit topology on $R$ and the topology given by the
  basis $C$ of exercise 8 of paragraph 13. Determine the closures of the intervals
  $A = (0, \sqrt{2})$ and $B = (\sqrt{2}, 3)$ in these two topologies.
}

Let's talk about lower limit topology first.

Suppose that $0 \in [a, b)$. We follow that $a \leq 0 < b$, and by density of reals we follow that
there exists $d \in R$ such that $0 < d < b$ and thus $d \in [a, b)$.
Thus we follow that every basis element that contains $0$ also intersects $A$, and thus
$0 \in \overline{A}$. We follow that $[\sqrt{2}, 2)$ is a neighborhood of $\sqrt{2}$ such that
it does not intersect $A$ at any point. Thus we follow that $\sqrt{2} \notin \overline{A}$.
There're plenty of methods to state that if $x < 0$ or $x > \sqrt{2}$, then it is not
in closure of $A$, therefore we conclude that $[0, \sqrt{2})$ is clousre of $A$ under
lower limit topology.

For $B$ we follow that pretty much the same logic holds with respect to different numbers,
and thus $\overline{B} = [\sqrt{2}, 3)$.

Now let's talk about the weird topology.

We can follow that pretty much the same argument holds for $0 \in \overline{A}$.
Now assume that $a \leq \sqrt{2} < b$. We follow that since $a \notin I$, that
$a \neq \sqrt{2}$, and thus we follow that $a < \sqrt{2} < b$. Thus 
we follow that $\sqrt{2} \in \overline{A}$. If $\sqrt{2} < c$,
then we follow that there exist rational $a, b$ such that $\sqrt{2} < a < c < b$,
and thus $c \notin \overline{A}$. If $c < 0$, then we have pretty much the same result.
Therefore we follow that $\overline{A} = [0, \sqrt{2}]$.

For the case of $B = (\sqrt{2}, 3)$, we follow that $[3, 5) \cap B = 0$, thus we follow that
$3 \notin \overline{B}$. We can easily follow that $\sqrt{2} \in \overline{B}$,
and the rest is followed by pretty much the same logic as in the previous paragraph.
Therefore we conclude that $\overline{B} = [\sqrt{2}, 3)$.

\subsection{}

\textit{Determine the closures of the following subsets of the ordered square:}

We're talking about the lexicographical order on the set $I \times I$ for $I = [0, 1]$.
We're also not gonna use the dumb notation.

\textit{$A = \set{\eangle{1/n, 0}: n \in Z_+}$}

Assume that there's an element of the basis that contains $\eangle{0, 0}$.
We follow that since $\eangle{0, 0}$ is the lowest element in the space, that
the only elements of basis that contain $\eangle{0, 0}$ are intervals in form
$(\eangle{0, 0}, \eangle{x_1, x_2})$. We follow that if $x_1 \neq 0$, then $x_1 > 0$,
and thus there exists 

If we've got a point $\eangle{x_1, x_2}$, then we follow that if $x_2 \neq 0$, then
there is a strand $(0, 1) \times \set{x_2}$ that does not intersect $A$, thus every point
of closure is nonzero in the second slot. We also follow that if we've got $\eangle{x_1, 0}$
where $x_1 \neq 0$ and $x_1 \notin A$, then there's also room for a basis element. therefore we
follow that $\overline{A} = A \cup \set{\eangle{0, 0}}$.
