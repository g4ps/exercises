\section{Boolean Functions and Formulas}

\subsection{}

\textit{$f \in B_n$ is called linear if $f(x_1, ..., x_n) = a_0 + a_1 x_1 + ... + a_n x_n$ for
  suitable coefficients $a_0, ..., a_n \in \set{0, 1}$}

We firstly going to assume that $+$ is associative and commutative.

\textit{(a) Show that the above representation of a linear function $f$ is unique}

By constructing an appropriate table we can prove that
$$a_0 + a_1 x_1 = b_0 + b_1 x_1 \iff a_0 = b_0 \land a_1 = b_1$$

Assume that
$$\sum_{i < n}{a_i x_i} = \sum_{i < n}{b_i x_i} \iff \set{a_n} = \set{b_n}$$
Now assume that
$$\sum_{i < n}{a_i x_i} + a_n x_n = \sum_{i < n}{b_i x_i} + b_n x_n$$
we follow that if $a_n \neq b_n$, then without loss of generality we can assume that
$a_n = 0$ and $b_n = 1$. Thus
$$\sum_{i < n}{a_i x_i} + x_n = \sum_{i < n}{b_i x_i}$$
Let $\set{q_n}$ be a vector of boolean variables. Substituting all the $x$'s in
$\sum_{i < n}{a_i x_i}$ for $q$'s we're going to get result $m$. If $m = 0$, then we can
set $x_n$ to $1$ to follow that
$$\sum_{i < n}{a_i q_i} + q_n = 1 \neq  \sum_{i < n}{b_i x_i}$$
and if $m = 1$, then we can set $q_n = 1$ to also get
$$\sum_{i < n}{a_i q_i} + q_n = 0 \neq  \sum_{i < n}{b_i x_i}$$
thus concluding that (attention to $\leq$)
$$\sum_{i \leq n}{a_i x_i} + a_n x_n = \sum_{i \leq n}{b_i x_i} + b_n x_n \lra \set{a_n} = \set{b_n}$$
now we can use the induction to conclude the desired result.

\textit{(b) Determine the number of $n$-ary Boolean functions}

For $n = 1$ we can follow that
$$f(x) = 1 + x = \neg x$$
$$f(x) = 0 + x = x$$
thus there are two of them. If there are $2^{n - 1}$ $(n-1)$-ary functions, then for each
$f \in B_{n - 1}$ there are
$$f(x) + 1 = \neg f(x)$$
and
$$f(x) + 0 =  f(x)$$
thus for each one of $2^{n - 1}$ $(n-1)$-ary functions we've got $2$ $n$-ary functions. Thus
we can use induction to conclude that there are $2^n$ $n$-ary functions.

\textit{(c) Prove that each formula $\alpha$ in $\neg, +$ (i.e. $\alpha$ is a formula of the
  logical signature $\set{\neq, +}$) represents a linear Boolean functions.}

This one is a standart pigeionhole problem (i.e. negating this proposition would imply the
contradiction for the previous point)

\textit{The rest of the exercises are pretty trivial, so I'm gonna leave them alone}
