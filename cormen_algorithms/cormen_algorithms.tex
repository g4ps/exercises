Exercises for Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al., 4th ed. It has some
exercises, that should be written down, moslty in math and whatnot.

\chapter{The Role of Algorithms in Computing}

\section{Algorithms}

\subsection{}

\textit{Describe your own real-world example that required sorting. Describe one
  that required finding the shortest distance between two points.}

I've needed both when I was creating 8-puzzle program

\subsection{}

\textit{Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency migh you need to consideer
  in a real-world setting?}

Memory and parallellability.

\subsection{}

\textit{Select a data structure that you've seen, and discuss its strengths and limitations.}

Linked lists. They are perfect in everything, apart from sorting; but even then you can define
any data structure through linked lists, which makes them just perfect (especially
omnidirectional ones).

\subsection{}

\textit{Suggest a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up
  with one in which "approximately" the best solution is good enough.}

Sorting has to be perfect, otherwise it's borderline useless. Estimated time to
complete the task can tolerate imperfections.

\subsection{}

\textit{Describe a real-world problem in which sometimes the entire input is available
  before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not
  entirely available in advance and arrives over time}

Traffic on maps does this thing. Sometimes you have all the input, sometimes it changes.


\section{Algorithms as a technology}

\subsection{}

\textit{Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the
  application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.}

Path finding on maps will do. It requires to triverse graphs and whatnot.

\subsection{}

\textit{Suppose that for inputs of size $n$ on a particular computer, insertion sort
  runs in $8n^2$ steps and merge sort runs in $64n \lg n$ steps. For which values of $n$
  does insertion sort beat merge sort?}

For
$$8 n^2 < 64 n \lg n$$
$$n <8 \lg n$$
$$\frac{n}{lg n} < 8$$
$$n \approx 44$$
cases.


\subsection{}

\textit{What is the smallest value of $n$ such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$
  runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine?}

Calculator says 15

\chapter{Summations}

\section*{1-1}
\textit{Prove that $\sum_{k  = 1}^n{O(f_k(i))} = O(\sum_{k  = 1}^n{f_k(i)})$}

Short answer:
$$\sum cg(x) = c\sum{g(x)}$$

Long answer:

Suppose that $g \in O(f_k(i))$. It follows that there exists $n_i$ and $c_i$
such that $0 \leq g(n) \leq cf_i(n)$. Thus we can pick
$n = \max\{n_0, n_1, ...\}$ and $c = \max\{c_0, c_1, ... \}$. We know that
both $n$ and $c$ will work all of functions $f_k$. Therefore by
linearity of summations
$$\sum_{k  = 1}^n{O(f_k(i))}
= \sum_{k  = 1}^n{cf_k(i)} =
= c\sum_{k  = 1}^n{f_k(i)} = 
= O(\sum_{k  = 1}^n{f_k(i)})$$
(notation is a little abused and there is nothing is rigorously
proven, but it'll do).

\section*{1-2}
\textit{Find a simple formula for $\sum_{k = 1}^n{(2k - 1)}$.}

$$\sum_{k = 1}^n{(2k - 1)} =
\sum_{k = 1}^n{(2k)} - \sum_{k = 1}^n{(1)} =
2\sum_{k = 1}^n{(k)} - n =
2\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - n =
n(n + 1) - n =
n^2
$$


\section*{1-3}
\textit{Interpret the decimal number $111,111,111$ in light of equation A.6}

$$111,111,111 = \sum_{k = 0}^{9}{10^k} = \frac{10^{10} - 1}{10 - 1}$$

\section*{1-4}
\textit{Evaluate the infinite series $1 - \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 4 - \frac 1 8
  + \frac{1}{16} - ...$}

The series converges absolutely to 2, so we are free to do anything with it.

$$1 - \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 4 - \frac 1 8
+ \frac{1}{16} - ... = 
\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{2}^{2k}}
- \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{2}^{1 + 2k}} =
\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{2}^{2k}}
- \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{2}^{2k}} =
\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{2}^{2k}} = 
$$
$$
= \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{4}^{k}}
= \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{4}}
= \frac 1 2 *  \frac 4 3 = \frac 2 3
$$

\section*{1-5}
\textit{Let $c \geq 0$ be a constant. Show that
  $\sum_{k = 1}^{n}{k^c} = \Theta(n^{c + 1})$}

$$
\sum_{k = 1}^{n}{k^c} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1}{k^c} + n^c =
n^c\sum_{k = 1}^{n}{\frac{k^c}{n^c}} =
$$

Let $f(n) = n^c$.
It can be seen from the graph that
$$\int_{0}^{n}{f(x)dx} \leq \sum_{k = 1}^{n}{k^c} \leq
\int_{0}^{n}{f(x + 1)dx}$$

Thus 
$$\int_0^n{f(x)dx} = \int_0^n{x^c} = \frac{n^{c + 1}}{c + 1} \in$$
$$\int_0^n{f(x + 1)dx} = \int_0^n{(x + 1)^c} = \frac{(n + 1)^{c + 1}}{c + 1}$$

Thus we can state that $\sum_{k = 1}^{n}{k^c} = \Theta(n^{c + 1})$
(I'm not good enough yet to show that $\frac{(n + 1)^{c + 1}}{c + 1} \in
\Theta(n^{c + 1})$, but I'm pretty sure that it's true TODO).



\section*{1-6}
\textit{Show that $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{k^2 x^k} = x(1 + x)/(1 - x)^3$ for
  $|x| < 1$}

We know that for $|x| < 1$
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{kx^k} = \frac{x}{(1 - x)^2}$$
thus if we differentiate both sides we get
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k^2x^{k - 1}} = \frac{2x}{(1 - x)^3}
+ \frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} $$
and then if we multiply all of it by $x$ we'll get
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k^2x^k} = \frac{2x^2}{(1 - x)^3}
+ \frac{x}{(1 - x)^2} $$
thus if we factor all of this jazz we'll get
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k^2x^k} = - \frac{x(x + 1)}{(x - 1)^3}$$
and if we tuck this minus into denominator we'll get (which we can do because
the power is odd)
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k^2x^k} = \frac{x(x + 1)}{(1 - x)^3}$$
as desired.

\section*{1-7}
\textit{Prove that $\sum_{k = 1}^n{\sqrt{k \lg k}} = \Theta(n^{3/2}\lg^{1/2}n)$}

$$\int \sqrt{k \lg k} = $$

\section*{1-9}
\textit{Show that}
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{(k - 1)/2^k} = 0$$

$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{(k - 1)/2^k} = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k/2^k} - \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{1/2^k} =
\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k/2^k} - 2 = 0$$

$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k/2^k} - 2 = 0$$
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k/2^k} = 2$$
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{k/2^k - 2} = 0$$
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{k - 2^{k + 1}}{2^k}} = 0$$


\chapter{Sets, Etc.}

\section*{1-1}
\textit{Draw Venn diagrams that illustrate the first of the distributive laws
(B.1)}

TODO, add picture here

\section*{1-2}
\textit{Prove the generalization of DeMorgan's laws to any finite collection
  of sets}

\textit{Copy from real analysis exercises}

Suppose that $x \in \left(\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda \right)^c$. It
follows, that $x$ is not in the union of given sets. Therefore there is no
set $E_n$ such that $x \in E_n$ (because if there would be such a set, then $x$
wouldn't be in $\left(\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda \right)^c$).
Therefore $x \in \cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda^c$. Therefore 
$$\left(\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda \right)^c \subseteq
\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda^c$$

The proof of reverse inclusion is the same as with the forward, but in reverse
order.

$x \in \left(\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda \right)^c$ implies that
$x$ is not in every $E_n$. Therefore there exists $x \in E_n^c$ for some $E_n$.
therefore it is in $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda^c$. The proof of
reverse inclusion uses the same argument, but in other direction.

\section*{1-3}
TODO

\section*{1-4}
\textit{Show that the set of odd natural numbers is countable.}

Let us set a function $f: A \to N$, where $A$ denotes the set of
odd natural numbers
$$f(n) = (n + 1) / 2$$
for this function  we've got
$$f^{-1}(n) = 2n - 1$$

Both funcitons are injective and therefore $f$ is bijective. Therefore
we've got a bijective function betweeen $A$ and $N$, therefore
$A \sim N$, therefore it is conuntable, as desired.

\section*{1-5}
\textit{Show that for any finite set $S$, the power set $2^S$ has
  $2^{|S|}$ elements (that is, there are $2^{|S|}$ distinct subsets of $S$).}

\textit{Another copy from real analysis}

This proof is dumb, but intuitive:

Every subset is corresponding to a number in binary system: 0 for excluded,
1 for included. Therefore there exist $2^n$ possible combinations.

For a more concrete proof let's resort to induction.

Base case(s): subsets of $\emptyset$ are $\emptyset$ itseft
($2^0 = 1$ in total). Subsets of
set with one element are $\emptyset$ and set itself ($2^1 = 1$ in total).

Proposition is that set with n elements has $2^n$ subsets.

Inductive step is that for set with $n + 1$ elements can either have or hot
have the $n + 1$'th element. Therefore there exist $2^n + 2^n = 2 * 2^n =
2^{n + 1}$ subsets, as desired.

\section*{1-6}
\textit{Give an inductive definition for an $n$-tuple by extending the
  set-theoretic definition for an ordered pair.}

The tuple is actually just a re-writing of particular set
$$(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) = \{\{a_1\}, \{a_1, a_2\}, \{a_1, a_2, a_3\} ...
\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n\}\}$$
