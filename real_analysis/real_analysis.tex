\section*{4.4.1}

\subsection*{{a}}
\textit{Show that $f(x) = x^{3}$ is continuous on all of \textbf{R}.}

In order to show, that $f$ is continous we need to show, that $\forall \epsilon \in \textbf{R}$ $\exists \delta$ s.t.
$$|x - c| < \delta \to |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$$

Let's rewrite the first formula

$$ |f(x) - f(c)| = |x^{3} - c^{3}| = |(x - c)(x^{2} + cx + c^{2})| = |x - c||x^{2} + cx + c^{2}|$$

We can put $|x - c|$ can be as small as we want it to be. Therefore we need an upper bound for $|x^{2} + cx + c^{2}|$.

$$|x^{2} + cx + c^{2}| \leq |x^{2}| + |cx| + |c^{2}| \leq (|c| + 1)^{2} + |c|(|c| + 1) + |c|^{2}$$



Therefore if we take
$\delta = min\{1, \epsilon/((|c| + 1)^{2} + |c|(|c| + 1) + |c|^{2})\}$
then
$$|x^3 - c^3| = |x-c||x^2 + cx + c^2| \leq \epsilon \frac{((|c| + 1)^{2} + |c|(|c| + 1) + |c|^{2}) }{ ((|c| + 1)^{2} + |c|(|c| + 1) + |c|^{2}}) = \epsilon$$

Therefore $f(x) = x ^3$ is continous on \textbf{R}.

\subsection*{(b)}
\textit{Argue, using Theorem 4.4.6, that f is not uniformly continuous on \textbf{R}}


\textbf{Theorem 4.4.6 (Sequential Criterion for Nonuniform Continuity).} A function $f:A \to \textbf{R}$ fails to be uniformly continuous on $A$ if $\exists \epsilon > 0 $ and  two sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ in $A$ satisfying

$|x_n - y_n| \to 0$ $but$ $|f(x_n) - f(y_n) \leq \epsilon_0$

In order to show that $f(x) = x^3$ is not uniformly continous on \textbf{R} let us use sequences

$$x_n = n$$
$$y_n = (n + 1/n)$$

Firstly
$$ |x_n - y_n| = |n - n - 1/n| = |-1/n| = 1/n \to 0$$

on the other hand

$$|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = |n ^ 3 - (n + 1/n) ^ 3| = |n^3 - (n^3 + 3 \frac{n^2}{n} + 3 \frac{n}{n^2} + \frac{1}{n^3})| = $$
$$ = |-3n - \frac{3}{n} - \frac{1}{n^3} | \leq |3n| \to \infty$$

rmaxima seems to eraborate this statement, therefore  $|x_n - y_n| \to 0$ but $|f(x_n) - f(y_n) \to \infty$

Therefore $f(x) = x^3$ is not uniformly continous on \textbf{R}.

\subsection*{(c)}
\textit{Show that $f$ is uniformly continuous on any bounded subset of \textbf{R}.}

Suppose that $A \subset \textbf{R}$ and $\exists M \in \textbf{R}$ s.t. $\forall x \in A$ $x \leq M$
(i.e. $A$ is bounded $M$)

Then, $\forall c \in A$ and $\forall \epsilon \in \textbf{R}$
$$\frac{\epsilon}{((|M| + 1)^{2} + |M|(|M| + 1) + |M|^2}  \leq \frac{\epsilon}{((|c| + 1)^{2} + |c|(|c| + 1) + |c|^2} $$

Therefore if we take
$$\delta = min\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{((|M| + 1)^{2} + |M|(|M| + 1) + |M|^2}\} $$
then $|x - c| < \delta$ implies, that $ |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$, therefore making $f(x)$ uniformly
continous by definition


\section*{4.4.2}
\textit{Show that $f(x) = 1/x^3$  is uniformly continous on the set $[1, \infty)$, but is not on the set $(0, 1]$}

In order to show, that $f(x)$ is continous on the set $[1, \infty)$ let us first prove that it is just continous, with the hope that $\delta$ is not depentant on $x$

$$ |\frac{1}{x^3} - \frac{1}{c^3}| = |\frac{c^3 - x^3}{x^3c^3}| = |\frac{(c - x)(x^2 + cx + c^2)}{x^3c^3}|
= |(c - x) \frac{x^2 + cx + c^2}{x^3c^3}| = |c - x||\frac{x^2 + cx + c^2}{x^3c^3}| =$$
$$ = |x - c||\frac{x^2 + cx + c^2}{x^3c^3}| $$

Therefore we need to show that if $\delta$ is bounded above at 1, then $|\frac{x^2 + cx + c^2}{x^3c^3}|$ is bounded above at $[1, \infty)$ by some constant, but  $(0, 1]$ isn't.

$$ |\frac{x^2 + cx + c^2}{x^3c^3}| = |\frac{1}{c^3 x} + \frac{1}{c^2x^2} + \frac{1}{cx^3}| \leq
|\frac{1}{c^3 x}| + |\frac{1}{c^2x^2}| + |\frac{1}{cx^3}|
$$

for $x \in [1, \infty)$ each of those fractions are bounded above by 1, therefore for $x \in [1, \infty)$

$$ |\frac{x^2 + cx + c^2}{x^3c^3}| \leq 3 $$

therefore if we pick $\delta < \epsilon / 3 $ then it follows, that $|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$ for $x \in [1, \infty)$

on the other hand,

$$ \lim_{x \to 0}(|\frac{x^2 + cx + c^2}{x^3c^3}|) \to \infty  $$

Therefore we will need smaller deltas as we approach 0; to put it more concretely let's use the theorem for
\textbf{Sequential Criterion for Nonuniform Continuity}.

Let us pick
$$x_n = 1/n$$
$$y_n = 1/(n + 1)$$

then

$$|x_n - y_n| = |\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1}| = |\frac{n + 1 - n}{n(n + 1)}| = |\frac{1}{n ^ 2 + 1}| \to 0$$

but

$$ |f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = |1/(\frac{1}{n})^3 - 1/(\frac{1}{n + 1})^3| = |1/(\frac{1}{n^3}) - 1/(\frac{1}{(n + 1)^3})| =  |n^3 - (n + 1)^3| =  $$
$$ = |n^3 - (n ^ 3 + 3 n^2 + 3 n + 1)| = |3n^2 + 3n + 1| \to \infty$$

therefore by \textbf{4.4.6} $f(x)$ is not uniformly continous on $(0, 1]$, as desired

\section*{4.4.3}
\textit{Furnish the details (including an argument for Exercise 3.3.1 if it is not already done) for the proof of the Extreme Value Theorem (Theorem 4.4.3).}

Let us first complete 3.3.1

\textit{Exercise 3.3.1. Show that if K is compact, then sup K and inf K both exist and are elements of K.}

Because $K$ is compact, it is both closed and bound; therefore, because it is bounded,


$$ \exists M \in \textbf{R} > 0 :  \forall x \in K $$
$$ |x| \leq M $$


Therefore there exist lower and upper bound of $K$. Therefore, by axiom of completenss, there exist
both $sup(K)$ and $inf(K)$ (i.e. both least upper bound and greatest lower bound)

Now let's prove that there exists a sequence that converges to either $sup(k)$ or $inf(k)$.
