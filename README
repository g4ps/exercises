My solutions for exercises in math and computer science adjacent topics

As of 07.01.25 (D/M/Y)

   - Understanding Analysis (Stephen Abbott, 1st ed.) - finished
   - Linear Algebra Done Right (Sheldon Axler, 3rd ed.) - finished
   - Set Theory, A First Course (Cunningham, 1st ed.) - finished
   - Topology (James Munkres, 2nd ed.) - 4th chapter
   - Probability and Statistics (DeGroot and Schervish, 4th edition) - 3rd chapter
   - Indroduction to Algorithms (Cormen et. al, 4th ed) - 4th chapter
   - Abstract Algebra An Integrated Approach (Joseph H. Silverman, 1st ed) - 6th chapter
   
Backlog:
   - Measure, Integration and Real Analysis by Sheldon Axler
   - Pearson series in computer science (there are several books in this series, I'll probably
   start with the AIMA)
   - Something on complex analysis
   - Concrete Mathematics (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik, 2nd ed.) - left on 2nd chapter
   - SICP - left on 1st chapter
   - Something on differential geometry
   - Something on ODE/PDE's
   - Something on functional analysis or something like that
   - A more in-depth (probably something from GTM) on real analysis
   - Something on Galois Theory
   - Something on logic (from GTM probably)

All of the solutions were written by me alone and none of them were checked by anyone with
any resemblance of competence.
