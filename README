My solutions for exercises in math and computer science adjacent topics

As of 28.04.23 (D/M/Y)

   - Understanding Analysis (Stephen Abbott, 1st ed.) - finished
   - Linear Algebra Done Right (Sheldon Axler, 3rd ed.) - finished
   - Indroduction to Algorithms (Cormen et. al, 4th ed) - 4th chapter
   - Set Theory, A First Course (Cunningham, assumed 1st ed.) - 5th chapter
   - Concrete Mathematics (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik, 2nd ed.) - started 1st chapter
   - Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View (Callahan, 1st ed.) - 2nd chapter (probably will
   drop this one)
   - SICP (1st chapter)
   - Probability and Statistics (DeGroot and Schervish, 4th edition) - 1st chapter
   - Abstract Algebra (Dummit, Foote, 3rd edition) - 2nd chapter
   
Planned books:
   - Topology: probably Mukres' book
   - Pearson series in computer science (there are several books in this series, I'll probably
   start with the AIMA)
   - Something on complex analysis
   - Something on differential geometry
   - Something on ODE/PDE's

All of the solutions were written by me alone and none of them were checked by anyone with
any resemblance of competence.
